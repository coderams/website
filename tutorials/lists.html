        "Lists are an extremely useful way to organize multiple variables.",
        "For example, let's say that you wanted to store five variables, and modify them several times.",
        "You could simply define five different variables, and modify each one, but this is very inefficient and tedious. Instead, we can use a list.",
        "Defining lists, at first glance, is similar to defining other types of variables. In fact, a list is just another type of variable, that stores different variables inside of it.",
        "To define a list, however, rather than simply placing a number, boolean, or string to the right of the equals sign, you place each element of the list separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets.",
        "For example, this code defines a list with three integer elements: 2, 3, and 4.",
        "[cd]myList = [2, 3, 4]",
        "Lists can also contain booleans, strings, or even other lists, which we'll explore in the tutorial on 2D lists.",
        "Unlike in Java or C++, the same list can contain different types of elements. For example, one list could contain a boolean, string, and two integers.",

        "[cd]list4 = [1, 1, 1, \"coderams\"]",
        "If you print out a list, it will print out each element separated by commas, and enclosed in brackets, the same syntax that you use to define a list, like this:",
        "[cd]list1 = [4, 5, 7, 9]",
        "[cd]print(list1) #prints \"[4, 5, 7, 9]\"",
        "[med]Accessing and Modifying Elements in Lists",
        "To access an element of a list, you first write the name of the list, and then enclose the index of the element you want to access in square brackets.",
        "The indices of a list start at 0! This is a very important thing to remember, and is a common mistake when using lists.",
        "Here are some examples of accessing list elements:",

        "To change the value of an element of the list, we can use a similar syntax to modifying variables. Instead of placing the variable name on the left side of the equals sign, however, we'll place the \"address\" of the list element: the list name, with the index in square brackets, like this:",

        "[cd]print(myList[len(myList) - 1]) #10",
        "There's a useful shortcut for this in Python: negative indices. If you access a negative index in a list, the list will return the index from the end, rather than the beginning.",
        "For example, the index -1 in a list will return the last element, -2 will return the second-to-last element, and so on. See these examples:",

        "The string shown above consists of several numbers, each one separated by a space.",
        "What if we wanted to convert the string into a list, where each element was each space-separated number in the string?",

        "[cd]convertedList = [3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15]",
        "To do this, we can use the .split() command.",
        "First, we'll need to define a new variable: convertedList",
        "We'll assign the string, converted to a list of its elements, to convertedList, by putting it on the right side of the equation, like this:",
        "[cd]exampleString = \"3 5 9 11 13 15\"",
        "[cd]convertedList = exampleString.split(\" \")",
        "The split command can be applied to any string, and will return a list of all of its characters, separated by whatever character is inside of the parentheses of the split command. This character is called the \"separator\".",
        "In this example, the characters are separated by spaces, so a space is the separator. This modified code will convert a string of numbers, separated by commas, into a list of the numbers:",
        "[cd]exampleString = \"3,5,9,11,13,15\"",
        "[cd]convertedList = exampleString.split(\",\") #a comma is now the separator",
        "However, there is one problem with this code: currently, all of the elements in convertedList are strings, instead of integers. For example, the first element of convertedList is \"3\", not simply 3.",
        "To change this, we can loop through and convert each element into an integer using the int() command:",
        "[cd]for i in range(0, len(convertedList)):",
        "[cd]    convertedList[i] = int(convertedList[i]) #converts each element to an integer",

        "[med]The Join Command",
        "The join command, essentially, is the opposite of the split command. Given a list of strings, the join command will return a string, containing each element of the list, separated by a given separator.",
        "The syntax of the join command is different from that of the split command, however. For example, this code will convert wordList into a single string containing all of the words, separated by spaces:",
        "[cd]wordList = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"CodeRams\", \"Club\"]",
        "[cd]wordString = \" \".join(wordList) #apply the join command to the separator, and put the list in parentheses",
        "Instead of applying the join command to the list and putting the separator in parentheses, to use the join command we have to apply the command to the separator, and put the list name inside of the parentheses.",
        "One application of the join command is printing out all elements of a list, without the brackets, like this:",
        "[cd]wordList = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"]",
        "[cd]print(\" \".join(wordList)) #prints \"hello world this is a list\"",
        "[med]The List Command",
        "What if we wanted to convert a string into a list, where each element was each character of the string?",
        "This can't be done with the split command, because there aren't any possible separators that would accomplish this. The easiest way to convert a string into a list of its characters is to use the list() command. The commands is slightly different from the split command:",

        "[cd]5",
        "[cd]2 5 7 3 1",
        "This is due to other languages like Java and C++ requiring you to know the length of a list before reading it in.",

        "For now, it's not important to know exactly how this \"list comprehension\" trick works. Just know how to use this one line of code, as it speeds up the process of solving coding problems considerably.",
        "[med]Reading in Space-separated Integers",
        "Some problems also can contain a line of a fixed number of integers.",
        "For example, the first line of input could contain two space-separated integers \"n\" and \"m\", and we would need to read them in to two different variables.",
        "First, we can read in the list containing \"n\" and \"m\" using the list comprehension trick described above:",
