      "[med]Defining 2D Lists",
      "First, let's discuss how to define a 2D list.",
      "To immediately define a 2D list, we can do something similar to how you define a 1D list. Like defining a 1D list, you separate each element with a comma, and enclose the list in square brackets. However, in this case, each element is another list, and we define each one in a similar way.",
      "[cd]example2Dlist = [[1, 2], [4, 6], [11, 13]]",
      "This code example defines a 2D list with three elements, with each sub-list having two elements. Note that the sub-lists of a 2D list don't all have to be the same length. In fact, you can even have a list where some elements are lists, and other elements are integers or strings. This is only rarely useful in coding problems, however.",
      "[med]Accessing Elements of 2D Lists",
